# Smart Farming using IoT
Tasked with developing an IoT-based application to assist farmers in monitoring crops, automating field irrigation, and optimizing fertilizer usage to increase crop yield. The objective is to install sensors for humidity, temperature, soil moisture levels, and air pollution to collect data, which will be sent to an Arduino device. Additionally, an application will be created to analyze this data.

The task involves installing sensors for humidity, temperature, soil moisture levels, and air pollution in the field to gather real-time data on crop conditions. This data is then transmitted to an Arduino device for processing. Subsequently, an application is developed to analyze the collected data and provide actionable insights to farmers for efficient crop management.
